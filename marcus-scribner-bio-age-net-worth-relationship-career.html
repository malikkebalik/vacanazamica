Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>American actor, singer, and voice actor Marcus Scribner is best known for playing Andre Johnson Jr. on the sitcom Black-ish. Marcus Scribner’s net worth is projected to be $1 million as of 2023.</p><h2><span id=Where_was_Marcus_Scribner_born_Ethnicity_Nationality_Family_Education>Where was Marcus Scribner born? Ethnicity, Nationality, Family, Education</span></h2><p>Scribner attended public schools while growing up in Los Angeles. His name is inspired by Roman and Greek mythology, just like those of his father Troy, and sister Athena. Zeus is a dog that Scribner also owns.</p><p>He got him when he was a puppy to honor his first acting gig. His mother is mixed (black and white), just like his Black-ish character, while his father is a black man. While his maternal grandmother is from England, his father’s family is from Los Angeles.</p><p>He started acting classes when he was seven years old. He had no interests at the moment and was a very bashful person.</p><p>In the same Los Angeles hospital as his mother, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Marcus Scribner was born on January 7, 2000. Marcus has a name with his sister Athena and father Troy that is rooted in Greek and Roman mythology.</p><p>Marcus, 19, is mostly African American with a 25% English background. Both his mother’s family and his father’s family are from England and Los Angeles, respectively.</p><p>Being bashful at the time, he attended an elementary school where the bulk of the children were Jews. Later in 2014, he enrolled in a public high school, but quickly switched to homeschooling in order to fit his 2015 job schedule.</p><h2><span id=Quick_fact>Quick fact</span></h2><ul class=quickList><li><strong>Date of Birth=</strong>Jan 07, 2000</li><li><strong>Age=</strong>21 Years, 7 Months</li><li><strong>Nationality=</strong>American</li><li><strong>Profession=</strong>Actor</li><li><strong>Marital Status=</strong>Single</li><li><strong>Gay/Lesbain=</strong>No</li><li><strong>Ethnicity=</strong>Mixed</li><li><strong>Net Worth=$1 million</strong></li><li><strong>Height=</strong>6 feet 1 Inch (1.85 m)</li><li><strong>Siblings=</strong>Athena Scribner (Sister)</li><li><strong>Parents=</strong>Troy Scribner (Father)</li></ul><h2><span id=Is_Marcus_Scribner_Single_Relationship>Is Marcus Scribner Single? Relationship</span></h2><p>While Marcus’ professional and familial lives are both in the public eye, his romantic side is not. There have been no rumors that Marcus is dating anyone, and there have also been no reports that the actor has been linked to any women who may qualify as his girlfriend.</p><p>Given his youth, it seems sense that he is more focused on his job than his love life. His dating life has been notoriously quiet.</p><p>It is hard to tell if he is gay because his single status does not indicate his sexuality.</p><p>But on the television show Black-ish, his on-screen persona was dating Annelise Grace’s character, a white blonde. The premise of the show was Marcus’ on-screen bi-racial relationship, as his mother grappled with her mixed-race identity.</p><p>In contrast, Marcus seems to be unmarried and is still pursuing his acting career.</p><h2><span id=How_tall_is_Marcus_Scribner_Weight_Hair_Color>How tall is Marcus Scribner?

It was a significant event and a turning point in his career.</p><p>For the part, he received an NAACP Image Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy.</p><p>Marcus might have built a fortune at such a young age considering that he makes an average of $50,000 each film as an actor.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Maxwell Bradley Garrett, Ceren Alkac, and Camaron Engel."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":4480,"10":2,"11":0,"15":"Arial"}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":34}{"1":36,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":47}{"1":53,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":66}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/maxwell-bradley-garrett/"}{"1":34}{"1":36,"2":"https://popularbio.com/ceren-alkac/"}{"1":47}{"1":53,"2":"https://popularbio.com/camaron-engels/"}{"1":66}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Maxwell Bradley Garrett</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Ceren Alkac</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Camaron Engel</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>actor</a></span><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Thea Tolentino</a></h3>Thea Tolentino estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
