Hernandez was serving life in prison for the murder, carrying his motive to the grave when he hanged himself in 2017.</p><p>“That’s one of the questions and, you know, head scratches that they still have regarding really this entire case,” his brother admitted.</p><p>“There’s just so many questions regarding everything. And, for me to sit here and say it was this or that, I can’t say. All you can do is look at the evidence that was provided.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3F7j2pma3Fflq6zu81mn56qnpa7pbHZZquemaKbwq242GarqKSUYrqwuYyhnGavkah6qK3YZpmenp%2Bnsm680aKqqKZdqMKqr8idnGaaoqTBqbHRZqqasaNk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./benjamin-rein-brady.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Benjamin Rein Brady">&larr;
