Len announced he would not be participating in the 32nd season of the dance competition as a judge. He declared:</p><p>While everyone is excited and looking forward to the finals next week, it is also with regret that I will be judging “Dancing with the Stars” for the last time.</p><p>It has been a pleasure to be a part of such a wonderful production since the show’s inception in 2005, but I’ve decided I need to spend more time with my family and kids.</p><p>Len has participated in the show as a judge for the past 17 years. Len thanked the DWTS family for a “wonderful experience” and expressed excitement for the show’s finale, which he believes will be “fantastic” after announcing his departure.</p><h2>DWTS judge Len Goodman</h2><p>Len Goodman’s age has made it “more difficult” to perform his role, which led to his decision to leave. He spoke to the audience:</p><p>I decided it’s better to go before I do because I haven’t dozed off or started dribbling on the program yet.</p><p>I’ll miss the warmth of the California sun, working with my colleague’s judges, and the teamwork on the show. I’ll miss being a part of one of television’s most well-known series and seeing famous people develop as dancers.</p><p>When the judge announced his retirement, there was a standing ovation. The host of the program, Tyra Banks, took advantage of the opportunity to praise the “living icon” for inspiring “generations of dancers all over the world” with his zeal, skill, and “laser-focused vision.”</p><p>In 1944, Len Goodman was born in London. When a doctor recommended dancing as a kind of rehabilitation for a foot issue, he started dancing at the age of 19. Later, he pursued a career as a professional dancer and took first place in various competitions.</p><p>After winning the British Championships in Blackpool, he stopped dancing in his late 20s. His role as the host of a reality TV dancing competition series is what most people recognize him for.</p><p>On the first UK season of DWTS, Strictly Come Dancing, he first made an appearance as the head judge. After thereafter, he presided as a judge for the first 20 seasons of DWTS before quitting after season 21.</p><p>From seasons 22 through 28, he then rejoined the judging panel before taking a second leave of absence in season 29. Before announcing his retirement, he made a comeback in Season 30. The 78-year-old has also hosted several documentary programs.</p><p>2013 saw the debut of Len Goodman’s Dance Band Days on BBC Four. On Boxing Day, he also hosted Holiday of My Lifetime and Len Goodman’s Perfect Christmas on BBC One, among other programs.</p><p>For his achievements in dancing, Goodman has won several awards, including the Carl Allen Award, the British Rising Star Award, the British Exhibition, and the Lifetime Achievement Award. He has also placed second in the Exhibition World Championships. Len further oversees a ballroom dance school in Dartford, Kent, England.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>A Look At The Success And Relationships Of Joan- Baez</a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Steve Rider</a></h3>Steve Rider estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
