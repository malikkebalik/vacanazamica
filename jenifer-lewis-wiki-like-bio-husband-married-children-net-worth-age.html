Veteran American actress, comedian, singer, and activist Jenifer Lewis AKA “Black Mother of Hollywood” also had a blind love once.&nbsp;Jenifer Lewis&nbsp;dated with a con man, and now she has filed a lawsuit against him and his former employer company.</h3><p>So what happened to the lawsuit?&nbsp;Jenifer Lewis&nbsp;is married to her husband and has a daughter, then why did she intend to attack her ex-boyfriend?

According to the actress, the aim is to help other women avoid a similar fate.</p><p>“The biggest message I want to get out is that a lot of us live in a bubble and we think things can’t happen to us, but they do. When it does happen to you, take care of yourself, and then get up.”</p><p>So what happened to the Lawsuit then? In mid-September&nbsp;2017, Lewis said that she dropped the lawsuit against LA fitness in return for monetary compensation.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jenifer_Lewis%E2%80%99_married_life_husband_and_children></span>Jenifer Lewis’ married life, husband, and children.<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jenifer Lewis is married to&nbsp;her husband, Arnold Byrd, a retired Marine 1st Sergeant.
