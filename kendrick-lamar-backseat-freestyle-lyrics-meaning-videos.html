The song starts with the repetition of Martin had a dream, a reference to Martin Luther King Jr.'s famous "I Have a Dream" speech. This can be seen as a nod towards the civil rights struggle faced by Black Americans and how it has influenced Kendrick's mindset as an artist. The lyrics then proceed to describe the rapper's desire for money and power, which he believes will elevate him to a grand status. He expresses an aspiration for sexual prowess, stating that he wants his private parts to be as large as the Eiffel Tower, allowing him to have sex with the world for three days. Lamar also talks about his desire for control, reflected in lines like "Respect my mind or die from lead shower," "I can tell ya who, what, when, where how To sell ya game right on time," and "I'm never living life confined". The rapper's confidence can be seen in lines like "My mind is living on cloud 9 and this 9 is never on vacation" and "This voice here is golden so f*** y'all I goes in". The song is a portrayal of the rapper's aggressive and tenacious personality, driven by the thirst for success.</p><br><p>Overall, the song seems to be about the inevitability of success for Kendrick Lamar, with his youth, talent, and ambition propelling him to greater heights. The song paints a vivid picture of his aspirations, desires, and dreams, backed by a beat that drives the energy and tempo of the lyrics. The song serves as a powerful representation of the modern-day hip-hop culture, where the glamorization of sex, power, and money is often at the forefront of the lyrics.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>Martin had a dream</u><br>Referencing the famous civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. and his famous "I Have a Dream" speech</p><br><p><u>Kendrick have a dream</u><br>Kendrick is sharing his own aspirations and desires for his life</p><br><p><u>All my life I want money and power</u><br>Kendrick desires financial stability and success, as well as the ability to control his own life</p><br><p><u>Respect my mind or die from lead shower</u><br>Kendrick demands that others respect his intellect and creativity or face the consequences of his anger and aggression</p><br><p><u>I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower</u><br>Kendrick desires sexual prowess and the ability to satisfy any partner</p><br><p><u>So I can fuck the world for 72 hours</u><br>Kendrick desires the ability to indulge in sexual activities for an extended period of time</p><br><p><u>God damn I feel amazing, damn I'm in the matrix</u><br>Kendrick feels incredibly confident and powerful, as if he's living in a fantasy world</p><br><p><u>My mind is living on cloud 9 and this 9 is never on vacation</u><br>Kendrick's thoughts are constantly focused on success and achieving his goals</p><br><p><u>Start up that Maserati and VROOM VROOM!</u><br>Kendrick is ready to take off and pursue his aspirations with speed and intensity</p><br><p><u>I'm racing</u><br>Kendrick is eager to compete and succeed against others</p><br><p><u>Poppin pills in the lobby and I pray they don't find her naked</u><br>Kendrick engages in illicit activities and is paranoid about the potential consequences</p><br><p><u>And I pray you niggas is hating, shooters go after Judas</u><br>Kendrick wishes for enemies and is not afraid to retaliate against them</p><br><p><u>Jesus Christ if I live life on my knees, ain't no need to do this</u><br>Kendrick would rather die than live a life of submission</p><br><p><u>Park it in front of Lueders, next to that Church's Chicken</u><br>Kendrick is sharing the specific location where he's parking his car, possibly indicating his own success and wealth</p><br><p><u>All you pussies is losers, all my niggas is winners, screaming</u><br>Kendrick believes himself and his friends to be superior to others, resulting in feelings of triumph and superiority</p><br><p><u>Goddamn I got bitches (okay!) damn I got bitches (okay!)</u><br>Kendrick is boasting about his sexual prowess and the number of partners he has</p><br><p><u>Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress</u><br>Kendrick has multiple partners, including a committed partner ("wifey"), a girlfriend, and a mistress</p><br><p><u>I've got 25 lighters on my dresser, yes sir</u><br>Kendrick has a large collection of lighters, possibly symbolizing his ability to light up the world and achieve his goals</p><br><p><u>Put fire to that ass body cast on a stretcher</u><br>Kendrick is ready to take down his enemies and destroy anyone who gets in his way</p><br><p><u>And her body got that ass that a ruler couldn't measure</u><br>Kendrick is attracted to a partner with exaggerated physical features, possibly indicating a preference for superficial qualities</p><br><p><u>And it make me cum fast but I never get embarrassed</u><br>Kendrick experiences intense pleasure from his sexual activities but is not ashamed or self-conscious about it</p><br><p><u>And I recognize you have what I've been wanting since that record</u><br>Kendrick is attracted to someone who possesses qualities that he's been searching for, possibly referring to himself as a musician or artist</p><br><p><u>That Adina Howard had pop it fast to impress her</u><br>Kendrick references the song "Freak Like Me" by Adina Howard, which features lyrics about women who are sexually adventurous and willing to "pop it fast"</p><br><p><u>She rollin' I'm holding my scrotum imposing</u><br>Kendrick is engaging in sexual activities and fully in control of the situation</p><br><p><u>This voice here is golden so fuck y'all I goes in and</u><br>Kendrick is confident in his own abilities and is not afraid to speak his mind or assert his dominance</p><br><p><u>All my life I want money and power</u><br>Kendrick desires financial stability and success, as well as the ability to control his own life</p><br><p><u>Respect my mind or nigga...
