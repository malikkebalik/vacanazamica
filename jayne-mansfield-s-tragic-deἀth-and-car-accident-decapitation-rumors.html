A semi-truck collided with the back of a car carrying Jane Mansfield and three of her children, including actress Mariska Hargitay, on a dark Louisiana highway at around two in the morning on June 29, 1967.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The three people in the front seat died instantaneously due to the collision, which tore off the top of Mansfield’s automobile. Amazingly, the kids who were dozing in the rear seat made it.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The terrible incident instantly sparked rumors about decapitations and wicked curses that are still being spread today. The reality of Jayne Mansfield’s deἀth, however, is far more horrifying and tragic than anything the rumor mill could conjure up.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Who Was Jayne Mansfield?</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Jayne Mansfield became well-known in the 1950s as a cartoonishly s*xy replacement for Marilyn Monroe. Mansfield, who was just 21 years old when she arrived in Hollywood and was already a wife and mother, was born Vera Jayne Palmer on April 19, 1933.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Mansfield was featured in movies, including 1956’s The Girl Can’t Help It, and 1960’s Too Hot to Handle. Though the actress played up her curves and marketed herself as a naughtier version of Monroe off-screen, she was best known for her personality there.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Hollywood reporter Lawrence J. Quirk once <a href=# rel=noopener>questioned Monroe&nbsp;about Jayne Mansfield</a>. Monroe complained-</strong></p><p style=text-align:justify>“All she does is imitate me, but her imitations are an insult to her as well as to myself.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>Monroe said, “I know it’s supposed to be flattering to be imitated, but she does it so grossly, so vulgarly – I wish I had some legal means to sue her.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>Jayne Mansfield didn’t avoid the conflict. She even actively pursued John F. Kennedy due to his romance with Marilyn Monroe. After catching the president, Mansfield chuckled, “I’ll bet Marilyn’s pissed as all get out!”</p><p style=text-align:justify>Mansfield wed actor and bodybuilder Mickey Hargitay, her second spouse, in 1958. The pair co-starred in several films together and had three kids; one of them was Mariska Hargitay. Mansfield had five kids overall after three marriages and divorces. She also engaged in several highly publicized relationships.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jayne-mansfield-accident-1.webp><p style=text-align:justify>Mansfield wasn’t embarrassed by her image as a s*x icon. She pretended to be a playmate for Playboy while stating, “I think s*x is healthy, and there’s too much guilt and hypocrisy about it.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>She pushed boundaries that other stars at the time wouldn’t touch due to her chaotic love life, which provided continual fodder for tabloids. She was notorious for flashing her breasts to paparazzi on the street, and in the 1963 movie Promises, Promises, she went nappy for the first time as a popular American actress.</p><p style=text-align:justify>She also didn’t avoid the camp. Mansfield was known for residing in the pink palace, a property in Hollywood with a swimming pool in the shape of a heart.</p><p style=text-align:justify>However, Mansfield expressed concern when she learned about Marilyn Monroe’s unexpected passing in 1962, saying, “Maybe I’ll be next.”</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Check the breaking news if you’re curious about recent happenings in your area:</strong></p><ul style=text-align:justify><li><a href=# rel=noopener>Chris Printup Founder of BORN X RAISED, Passed Away in a Car Accident</a></li><li><a href=# rel=noopener>1&nbsp;Person is Killed in a Car Crἀsh Involving Ten Cars in Upland</a></li></ul><h2 style=text-align:justify>The Fatal Car Accident in June 1967</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Jayne Mansfield passed away in a vehicle accident five years after Marilyn Monroe. Mansfield left Biloxi, Mississippi, early on June 29, 1967, and headed toward New Orleans. The actress needed to get to New Orleans for a television appearance the next day after performing at a nightclub in Biloxi.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Have a Look at the tweet that IIHS shared on Aug. 3, 2018-</strong></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Underride guards are sometimes referred to as Mansfield bars, a reference to actress Jayne Mansfield, who was killed in a rear underride crash near New Orleans in 1967. Her high-profile death helped draw attention to the inadequate 1953 standards. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/0GEnSI85Ld</a></p><p>— IIHS (@IIHS_autosafety) <a href=# rel=noopener>August 3, 2018</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>Mansfield sat before her boyfriend, Samuel S. Brody, and the driver, Ronald B. Harrison, for the lengthy trip. Her three kids dozed out in the backseat.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The 1966 Buick Electra struck the back of a trailer truck shortly after two in the morning, instantly killing everyone in the front seat. A nearby machine spewing heavy fog to kill mosquitos probably prevented Harrison from spotting the truck until it was too late.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Jayne Mansfield’s Deἀth</h2><p style=text-align:justify>The top of the Buick Electra was severed when it fell under the trailer after colliding with the truck. Mansfield’s three children were discovered in the backseat still alive when police arrived on the scene. The three adults in the front seats died instantaneously from the collision, along with Mansfield’s dog. The actress was pronounced deceased by police at the scene.</p><p style=text-align:justify>As information about the horrific accident spread, speculations surfaced that Jaynes Mansfield had been beheaded in the collision.<strong> The images of Jayne Mansfield’s deἀth made public after the tragedy fueled the speculations.</strong> In other photos, it appeared her head had been severed since her wig had been tossed from the automobile.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Police claim that Mansfield died in a horrifying manner that was almost instantaneous. <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>According to the police report</a>,</strong> “the upper portion of this white female’s head was severed shortly after the accident.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>Mansfield’s deἀth certificate confirms that she suffered from a scalping injury rather than a complete decapitation, with her head crushed and her cranium partially separated. The beheading tale, however, is still often told and was even included in the 1996 film Crash.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>The latest incidents happening in your area can be found in the headlines:</strong></p><ul style=text-align:justify><li><a href=# rel=noopener>5 Teenagers, Including 4 Texas Roadhouse Employees, Die After Car Crash into Florida Pond</a></li><li><a href=# rel=noopener>Did Natanael Cano D!ed In Car Accident? What Is The Truth?</a></li></ul><p style=text-align:justify>After Mansfield’s supposed beheading, another rumor surfaced. The celebrity, who had dated Church of Satan founder Anton LaVey, was slain by a curse that LaVey allegedly placed on her boyfriend, Brody.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Of course, there is no proof of this rumor. But it, too, endures partly because of the 2017 film Mansfield 66/67. Bookmark <a href=# rel=noopener>TheCurrentOnline.com</a> and check back frequently to see if any changes have been made.
