He is also a Marine veteran, race car driver, and accomplished motorcycle rider. All of his efforts have helped put his net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Larry Wilcox? As of mid-2016, sources estimate a net worth that is at $1.5 million, mostly earned through a successful career in acting. He has formed his own production company, and done some production work as well. He’s also made several guest appearances and cameos, all of which have ensured the position of his wealth.</p><h3>Larry Wilcox Net Worth $1.5 million</h3><p>Wilcox attended Rawlins High School, and after matriculating tried his hand at various jobs including acting. In 1967, he joined the US Marines and served for 13 months in Vietnam during one of the largest military campaigns called the Tet Offensive. In 1973, he was honorably discharged with the rank of Staff Sergeant. Afterwards, he went on to finish his studies at Cal State Northridge.</p><p>One of his first roles as an actor came as a guest appearance in 1971’s “Room 222”. He then appeared in an episode of “The Streets of Francisco” before starring in “Lassie”. He continued making regular appearances in television shows such as “Cannon”, “Hawaii Five-O”, and “Police Story”, and becoming part of the film “The Last Hard Men”. He also made various commercials during this period.</p><p>In 1977, Larry was cast to become part of the action series “CHiPs” which was about California Highway Patrol motorcycle officers. During his time with the show he performed a lot of his own stunts, but never suffered any major injuries. During the peak of the popularity of the show, Larry was said to be making $250,000 per episode which significantly boosted his net worth, and along with co-star <a href=#>Erik Estrada</a>, he appeared on the cover of TV Guide three times. In 1978, rumors started circulating on how the two co-stars were not on good terms with each other, but Wilcox told the press that it was just exaggerated. However, after the show’s run, the cast members would reunite during the show’s 35th anniversary though <a href=#>Erik Estrada</a> did not show up.</p><p>After “CHiPs”, Larry started his own production company entitled Wilcox Productions and it would be responsible for producing “The <a href=#>Ray Bradbury</a> Theatre”, “The Yorkshire Ripper” and “The Wolfman Jack Story”. During this time he was involved in directing, as well as continuing to act. He also started to branch out and work with other distribution companies, becoming the executive producer of “Death of a Playmate: The Dorothy Stratten Story”. He also appeared in “The Dirty Dozen: Next Mission” before reuniting with Estrada in “National Lampoon’s Loaded Weapon 1”, and then reprising his role of Jon Baker in “CHiPs ‘99”, and would later do a cameo in an episode of “30 Rock”.<br>For his personal life, it is known that Larry married Judy Vagner in 1969 and they had two children together but divorced in 1978. His second marriage was to Hannie Strasser in 1980 and they had a daughter but divorced in 1982. In 1986, he married Marlene Harmon who was part of the 1980 Olympic heptathlon team. They have two sons, and currently reside in the San Fernando Valley.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=19.47619047619><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Larry Wilcox</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$1.5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>August 8, 1947</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>San Diego, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 10 in (1.79 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actor</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Education</td><td>California State University, Northridge, Rawlins High School, University of Chicago</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Spouse</td><td>Marlene Harmon (m. 1986), Hannie Strasser (m. 1980–1982), Judy Vagner (m. 1969–1978)</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Children</td><td>Derek Wilcox, Heidi Wilcox, Wendy Wilcox, Chad Wilcox, Ryan Wilcox</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>John C.
