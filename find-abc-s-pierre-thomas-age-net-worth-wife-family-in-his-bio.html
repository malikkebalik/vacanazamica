His dad's factory work often included "sweat running out of" his shoes. He used to work in hot environment molding steels even in cold days. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>While he learned morale from his father, he understood how to bond with people from his sociable mother.</p><h3><strong>Less Known Facts About&nbsp; Pierre Thomas Bio & Age</strong></h3><p>An adult man in his fifties (birthday:19 March), Pierre Thomas, is one of the finest journalists in the country, not only respected and well-liked by his peers and colleagues, but also by the law enforcement offices and audience. He has a clear vision about his job as a journalist, and every day he comes to work prepared to be the best in the business. He has been interested in journalism ever since his early childhood. At age 12, he had discovered that he wanted to be a journalist upon watching the news show, World News Tonight, featuring Peter Jennings and Max Robinson.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Thomas is the youngest of his five siblings born to a typical southern Virginia family consisting of factory worker father (father worked at Lynchburg Foundry)&nbsp;and homemaker mother. He is a 1980 graduate of Amherst County High School and a 1984 graduate of Virginia Tech.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In 1987, he joined The Washington Post, where he would work for 10 years before sending his clips to&nbsp;CNN officials in order to try Television journalism. At this point, a switch from print journalism to Television journalism was a new challenge for him, but he accepted the task and worked at CNN for 3 years.</p><h3><strong>Pierre Thomas Wanted To Pursue This Profession Before Journalism</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>As we know Pierre has been interested in journalism since his childhood, but journalism wasn't his ideal path. His working-class family always wanted him to do good in his studies. He was a bookish kid, feeble in sports, and a salutatorian, in his high school. He eventually went on to graduate from Amherst County High School in 1980 before enrolling at Virginia Tech&nbsp;to pursue&nbsp;a career in business and computer science in the future.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p><strong>You may like:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# title="Terrell Brown With Partner At Age 29?

He switched to journalism in his sophomore year with advice from the professor and&nbsp;permission from his supportive parents, who knew nothing about journalism and whether it would sustain the living of their beloved son.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The professor, whose name is Yera, helped him to get jobs in The Roanoke Times and World-News after his graduation. While at these non-national media outlets, he developed his early journalism prowess, covering everything from politics to crime, staying true to his professor's teaching to follow stories with passion and honesty.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><h3 dir=ltr><strong>When Did Pierre Thomas Join ABC News and His Achievements There?</strong></h3><p>The Amherst native joined ABC in November 2000 and reports for “World News with Charles Gibson,” “Good Morning America,” “Nightline” and other ABC News programs<strong>.</strong>&nbsp;He has made great achievements in his ABC career, covering significant national to local events.</p><p>Thomas was a key member of ABC’s team of correspondents covering the terrorist attacks of September 11, which earned the network a Peabody, DuPont-Columbia and Emmy Award. He also participated in a “World News Tonight with Peter Jennings” broadcast which won the Edward R. Murrow Award for best newscast in 2005.

In his decades-long productive career, he has received several awards&nbsp;covering the nation’s most important news broadcasts. He not only reports the stories on-screen but also sometimes does behind the scenes operations and reporting of critical cases that often demands danger and caution.

He has earned such a high reputation and senior post in the mainstream American Media. However, his accurate net worth remains undisclosed.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><h2><strong>This Is How He Convinced His Love At First Sight To Become His Wife</strong></h2><p>Thomas met his current wife, Allison, at a friend’s wedding, where Allison ignored him initially. But later, Pierre’s colleagues encouraged him to call her. He then gathered the courage and called her up and convinced her to go out with him.
