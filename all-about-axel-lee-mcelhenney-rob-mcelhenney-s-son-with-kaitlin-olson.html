His birth was quite a remarkable story because his mother, Kaitlin Olson, who was heavily pregnant at the time, had gone to watch the Philadelphia Phillies play against the Los Angeles Dodgers in a Major League Baseball (MLB) game, and while the game was still on, she went into labor.</p><p>She was rushed out of the venue to her home, where she gave birth to a bouncing baby boy, who turned out to be Axel Lee Mcelhenney. He&nbsp;is an American national of Caucasian ethnicity. He has one younger brother named Leo Grey McElhenney, born on April 5, 2012. Both boys are only two years apart and are the only children of their parents.</p><p>At the moment, he is estimated to be about 4 feet 2 inches tall. Axel is blue-eyed and has light brown hair. He attends a Los Angeles-based middle school along with his brother. Neither the name nor the address of the school is available to the public, and it’s because of Rob and Kaitlin’s desire to keep their sons safe.</p><p>Judging from the American educational system, Axel is, however, expected to remain in middle school for the next three years at least.</p><h2><strong>Axel Lee McElhenney’s Parents Are Still Together After Being Married In 2008</strong></h2><p>As mentioned earlier, Axel Lee Mcelhenney is the firstborn son of actors Rob McElhenney and Kaitlin Olson. Both actors met in the course of their work in Hollywood and, before long, were engaged and married. They initially met on the set of the hit television show, It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia—in which they were both featured—in 2005. They began dating and did so for three years.</p><p>While Rob admitted that he was especially attracted to Kaitlin’s unique sense of humor, his co-star turned fiancee said she liked Rob because of his bubbly personality. Rob and Kaitlin tied the knot in September 2008 in California, United States of America. The wedding was a colorful ceremony with family, friends, and industry colleagues present.</p><p>It’s been over a decade since they first met, and the McElhenneys are still waxing strong together. There have been no public scandals concerning the two since then, and things seem likely to remain that way. The couple is known for their collaborative projects and has been known to produce shows together. They even jointly purchased a bar in Philadelphia as far back as 2009.</p><p>Rob and Kaitlin are currently working together on several projects at the moment, one of which is a comedy TV show expected to hit our screens in no due time.</p><h3><strong>Axel’s Father Rob Mcelhenney is Best Known for His Appearance in It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia</strong></h3><p>If you aren’t familiar with the name Rob McElhenney, you might readily recall him from the comedy series, It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia. But let’s take a little look at Rob’s background first. The American actor was born on April 14, 1977, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the United States of America, to parents Helena McElhenney and Robert McElhenney.</p><p>He was, however, raised by a lesbian couple after his parents got divorced and his mother remarried. Rob attended the Waldron Mercy Academy and later St. Joseph’s Preparatory School. He entered Hollywood in 1996 when he was just 19 years old and has been in the showbiz industry since then. His career encompasses acting, comedy, television hosting, as well as movie production, and directing.</p><p>Rob’s filmography includes projects like the podcast dubbed Dennis & Dee’s, Thirteen Conversations About One Thing, The Mindy Project, and many others. In all of the aforementioned shows, his wife, Kaitlin, was also featured alongside him.</p><p>Born on August 18, 1975, in the USA, <strong>Kaitlin Olson</strong> is the daughter of popular newspaper publisher Donald Lee Olson and nurse Melinda Leora. Upon Kaitlin’s graduation from high school at Tigard, she studied Theater Art at the University of Oregon and graduated in 1997. She then relocated to The City of Angels to kick start her acting career. She became a professional performer in 2000 and has worked in countless television shows and movies since then.</p><p>Currently, Rob McElhenney is worth about $56 million, all earnings from his film career. Kaitlin also has earnings running into millions as well; however, her exact net worth has been kept private.</p><h2><strong>Rob McElhenney’s Son is a Rich Kid By All Standards</strong></h2><p>Axel Lee’s net worth is still being reviewed. This is because he is still a minor and hasn’t embarked on any defined career path yet. This doesn’t make his lifestyle anything less than ostentatiously luxurious. According to several estimations, his family lives in a million-dollar mansion in a choice area in Los Angeles.</p><p>His father’s successful showbiz career has left him over $50 million rich, at least half of which Axel is expected to inherit sometime. All of that is in addition to his mother’s wealth as well. For now, Axel remains a school kid who does nothing but has fun with his brother and friends. He knows nothing about his parents’ high-profile jobs and their immense wealth.</p><h3><strong>Axel Lee McElhenney is Not Active on Social Media Yet</strong></h3><p>Although young Axel is the son of two prominent actors, he has no television career yet. It seems that his parents have decided to keep him as far away from the spotlight as possible. Axel is so private that even pictures of him are hard to come by on the internet.</p><p>The 13-year-old doesn’t yet have any social media handle and only pops up on either of his parents’ social media pages.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunCty6VkmpqfqsFurdeeo2aklZp6rq%2FEpZ%2Bepp6axm6%2BzptkppuVobWmus2esKxlo6S7bsPIrZ9mo5Gewa21zWampaufo3w%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./fame-bernadette-sz%C5%91cs-net-worth-and-salary-income-estimation-jan-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Bernadette Szcs net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024">&larr;
