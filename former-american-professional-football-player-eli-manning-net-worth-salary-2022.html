He quickly signed with the New York Giants after initially turning down the opportunity to play for the San Diego Chargers. He signed a six-year contract with the Giants for an estimated $45 million, which paid off in spades. He didn’t look back after that and achieved enormous success.</p><p>His first year with the Giants wasn’t particularly successful, but the following year was because they defeated the Cardinals and Saints. When Manning assisted the team in making it to the Super Bowl XLll, they took on the New England Patriots. Eli and his brother became the first winners of the Super Bowl MVP as a result of their victory. His 2009 performance came to an end with a 93.1 passer rating.</p><p>He played the 2010 season admirably, helping the Giants defeat the Washington Redskins, but they were unable to advance to the Super Bowl, which the Green Bay Packers eventually won. Following a comeback, the Giants competed in the SuperBowl XLVI, which was successful and won, where they defeated the Patriots. He had a career-high number of passes and touchdowns in 2016.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Eli Manning (@eli.manning10)</a></p><h2><strong>Awards and Achievements</strong></h2><p>Looking at his accomplishments reveals that he made a total of 77 touchdowns and 64 interceptions from his rookie season in 2004 to the regular season in 2007.</p><p>His career winning percentage has been around 500 on average.
