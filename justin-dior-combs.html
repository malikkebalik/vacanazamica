However, he is best known as the son of Sean Combs – aka Puff Daddy – and costume designer Misa Hylton-Brim.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_Justin_Dior_Combs_Salary_Earnings>What is the Net Worth of Justin Dior Combs? Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>Combs’ <strong>net worth</strong> exceeds $3 million as a result of his involvement in the entertainment industry, including his acting debut and guest appearances on several TV shows. His net worth includes a $360,000 silver Maybach automobile.</p><h2><span id=Justin_Dior_Combs-_Birth_Age_Ethnicity_Siblings_Education>Justin Dior Combs- Birth, Age, Ethnicity, Siblings, Education</span></h2><p>Justin Dior Combs is a Christian who was born to renowned parents. He is American by ethnicity and belongs to a mixed ethnic group. Justin spent his early years in his birthplace of Mount Vernon, where he attended California School before moving on to Catholic Iona Preparatory High School in New Rochelle, New York. He matriculated at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he earned a Bachelor’s degree in Sociology in 2016.</p><p>Justin is the eldest biological child of his parents and has five half-siblings. From his father’s on-again, off-again relationship with the late model, actress, and singer Kimberly ‘Kim’ Porter, he has a half-brother named Christian Casey Combs and twin half-sisters D’Lila Star and Jessie James. He has a half-sister, Chance, from his father’s romance with Sarah Chapman, and an adopted brother, Quincy Brown, from Kim Porter and musician Al B. Sure. From his mother’s marriage to Jojo Brim, he has a half-brother named Niko Brim and a half-sister named Madison Brim.</p><h2><span id=Justin_Dior_Combs-_Relationship_Girlfriend>Justin Dior Combs- Relationship, Girlfriend</span></h2><p>Between 2010 and 2011, Justin Dior Combs dated actress Paige Hurd. Following their breakup, he began dating model Chantel Jeffries in late 2011, but their relationship ended the following year. Justin had an affair with social media sensation India Westbrooks from 2014 to 2015. Despite Justin’s extensive dating history, an Instagram blog claimed he is gay — the account was eventually shut down by his father. Justin has been dating Alexis Skyy, a reality TV star, since February 2018.</p><h2><span id=Justin_Dior_Combs-_Professional_Career>Justin Dior Combs- Professional Career</span></h2><p>Combs fell in love with American Football at a young age. Justin became a prospective national player while attending Catholic Iona Preparatory High School and joining the school’s squad under coach Victor Quinlo, strengthening his skills and establishing himself as a player. He was ranked 132nd in the cornerback category by ‘ESPN,’ and was named All-State and All-American.</p><h3><span id=UCLA_Scholarship_and_Disagreement>UCLA Scholarship and Disagreement</span></h3><p>In 2012, Justin was awarded a football scholarship at UCLA, which sparked outrage in the media. He was chastised for accepting the scholarship because he is the son of a multi-millionaire, despite the fact that the $54,000 scholarship could have helped another student who does not come from a wealthy family.</p><p>In his defense, he argued that he received it based on his abilities rather than his family’s riches, which the college agreed with. As a result, Justin joined the UCLA Bruins football team, led by head coach Jim Mora. He was a cornerback until his senior year when he transferred to the position of defensive quarterback. Justin appeared in seven games and had four tackles throughout his college career.</p><h3><span id=Participation_in_the_Entertainment_Industry>Participation in the Entertainment Industry</span></h3><p>Justin Dior Combs also enjoys acting and dancing.
