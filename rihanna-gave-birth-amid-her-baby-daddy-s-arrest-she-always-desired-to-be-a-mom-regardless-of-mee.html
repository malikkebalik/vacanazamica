When she finally became pregnant with A$AP Rocky's baby, he was embroiled in a police matter when she gave birth.</p><p class=dh>A$AP Rocky and Rihanna were longtime friends before they started dating. They initially sparked dating rumors after the pop singer broke up with her billionaire boyfriend, Hassan Jameel, in January 2020.</p><p class=dh>Rihanna and Jameel had seen each other for three years before their relationship ended. The Sun was the first to report the songstress and rapper's alleged relationship, but a different source claimed Rihanna was still single.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/f65de6cd8880793d553bd2f149937850.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>A$AP Rocky and Rihanna pose for a picture while celebrating Fenty Beauty and Fenty Skinat Goya Studios on February 11, 2022, in Los Angeles, California. | Source: Mike Coppola/Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Then in May 2021, Rocky was interviewed by GQ magazine, where he admitted he was dating Rihanna. The musician allegedly started "beaming like a teenager" whose crush had accepted their prom invite when he spoke about his girlfriend.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/c69a313be07764edf5039ee9bfc76027.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>A$AP Rocky seen on December 5, 2021, in New York City. | Source: Robert Kamau/GC Images/Getty Images</p><p class=dh>The interviewer swore he could hear angels singing when Rocky started talking about Rihanna, whom he <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.gq.com/story/asap-rocky-june-july-2021-cover>described</a> as "My lady" and "The love of my life." He even <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.gq.com/story/asap-rocky-june-july-2021-cover>revealed</a> the relationship was great because he had found "the one."</p><p class=dh>During Christmas in 2020, the fashion and beauty entrepreneur was photographed with Rocky in Barbados. The country happens to be where Rihanna was born and from where Rocky's father emigrated to get to the US.</p><p class=dh>The visit left the rapper with a sense of belonging and nostalgia when he got to see the places his father probably went to. When asked if he was ready to be a father, Rocky said if it was fate, then he was game.</p><p class=dh>He jokingly shared how he thought he was already a father to those close to him. Taking the matter seriously, he <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.gq.com/story/asap-rocky-june-july-2021-cover>explained</a> that he thought he'd make a remarkable, incredible, and amazing father with a "fly child."</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>RIHANNA ANNOUNCES PREGNANCY AFTER HIDING IT FROM HER FRIENDS</strong></p><p class=dh>In February 2022, Rihanna spoke to E! News about trying to keep her first pregnancy with Rocky a secret.

It was strange for the singer's friends when she didn't want alcoholic drinks or smokes.</p><p class=dh>Rihanna also made it evident because she changed her diet and started eating things she hadn't before. An example of this was how her friends knew she hated sweet things, but suddenly she asked for donuts and cookies.</p><p class=dh>The songstress finally had to confess, and her friends were shocked; in fact, the whole world was shocked. The star also shared how she felt when the news was first confirmed to her, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.eonline.com/news/1319587/rihanna-recalls-keeping-her-pregnancy-a-secret-from-her-friends>stating</a>:</p><p class=dh>"When I first found out, it's not real, you know? I was like, 'This is not for real, right?'"</p><p class=dh>Rihanna didn't want to get too excited because it was too soon, and she wanted to make sure the pregnancy would stick. However, she was happy when she got far along enough to be able to celebrate with other people.</p><p class=dh>On February 3, 2022, the pop star showed off her growing baby bump in an Instagram photo thread.

The rave-themed event saw Rocky and the "Diamonds" singer flying out friends and family from Barbados to the US.</p><p class=dh>The joint celebration was an intimate and private Hollywood affair. Guests weren't allowed to take photos or record videos, and when they arrived, they were told to keep any pictures in secure pouches.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>A$AP ROCKY'S ARREST</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/d0399a07e704adc8d0dcffa048163636.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>A$AP Rocky and Rihanna at the Costume Institute Benefit - In America: A Lexicon of Fashion on September 13, 2021, in New York City. | Source: Sean Zanni/Patrick McMullan/Getty Images</p><p class=dh>In April 2022, TMZ reported that <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.tmz.com/2022/04/20/asap-rocky-arrested-lax-rihanna-pregnancy/>Rocky was arrested</a> at Los Angeles' LAX after flying from Barbados on a private jet.
