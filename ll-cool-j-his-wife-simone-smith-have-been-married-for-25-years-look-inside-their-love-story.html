Their love story started in the 80s, and it’s truly amazing.</p><p class=dh>LL Cool J told Jimmy Kimmel in 2012 that he met <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ll-cool-j-marriage_n_1415122>Simone Smith</a> during Easter in 1987. At the time, he was 19 years old and was driving around the block in his mom’s car.</p><p class=dh>The rapper saw a friend and stopped to say hello, and the guy asked him if he wanted to meet his cousin, Smith. Initially, he didn’t want to, but he changed his mind as soon as he saw Smith.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/065f0c0725e1fbbfd4b2031159da639a.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Simone Smith and LL Cool J on February 26, 2017 in Beverly Hills, California | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>LL COOL J AND SMITH’S RELATIONSHIP</strong></p><p class=dh>The couple started dating shortly after that, and after dating for years, he proposed in a very particular way: he <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.essence.com/love/ll-cool-j-wife-simone-pictures/>sped in his Porsche</a> and was unwilling to slow down until she said yes.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>[Smith] required two and a half years to fully recover.</strong></h3><p class=dh>In 1995, LL Cool J and Smith <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.romper.com/p/how-did-ll-cool-j-meet-simone-smith-their-story-is-seriously-sweet-5465>tied the knot</a> and now <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.essence.com/love/ll-cool-j-wife-simone-smith-reflects-23-years-marriage/>share four children</a>, daughters Italia, Nina, and Samaria, and son Najee. Unfortunately, their relationship has faced many challenges.</p><p class=dh>Back in 2004, Smith found a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.essence.com/love/ll-cool-j-wife-simone-pictures/>lump on her leg</a>, and after getting it tested, doctors discovered she had bone cancer. Her husband, who supported her during her treatment, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Pcrasl6trU">said</a>:</p><p class=dh>“You don’t abandon someone in that foxhole. […] So I made some decisions professionally and decided to be by Simone’s side during that period.”</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>GETTING TREATMENT FOR CANCER</strong></p><p class=dh>In order to get better, Smith underwent a 15-hour surgery. That was the easy part, though, as she required two and a half years to fully recover. During that time, she had to learn to walk again.</p><p class=dh>LL Cool J’s wife has been <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.countryliving.com/life/entertainment/a28577998/ll-cool-j-wife-simone-i-smith-marriage-kids/>cancer-free</a> for over a decade now, but they keep in mind how hard dealing with cancer is, so they try to raise awareness through the Beat Cancer Like a Boss campaign.</p><p class=dh>Throughout their time together, they’ve shared <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.countryliving.com/life/entertainment/a28577998/ll-cool-j-wife-simone-i-smith-marriage-kids/>some advice</a> on keeping a loving marriage. The rapper once said that mutual respect and knowing how your spouse wants to be loved were critical.</p><p class=dh>Smith, on the other hand, admitted that putting God first was also crucial. She added that showing compromise, respecting each other, and picking battles wisely were vital, too.</p><p class=dh>Nowadays, <a class="me a" href=#>Smith</a> is running her <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://heavy.com/entertainment/2015/02/ll-cool-j-wife-simone-smith-grammy-awards-host/>jewelry company</a>, Simone I.
