He likens his need for his significant other to the blood running through his veins, stating that he will love them until now and forever. When he is feeling lonely and his head gets dark and heavy, he is comforted by the thought of his partner's presence.</p><br><p>The chorus reinforces the idea that he needs his significant other as much as flowers need rain and the sun. He wants them to take things one step at a time and not leave him, even if they temporarily blind him with their light. He recognizes that they turn the noise into silence and make everything vibrant, and he is no longer afraid of their violence because he knows he won't run away.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline
