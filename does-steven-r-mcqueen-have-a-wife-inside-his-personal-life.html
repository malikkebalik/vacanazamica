McQueen has stolen the hearts of his fans and followers with his adorable smile and charming personality.&nbsp;However, most fans wonder if there is someone who has managed to steal the actor's heart.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>McQueen&nbsp;rose to fame through his role as Jeremy Gilbert,&nbsp;Elena Gilbert's younger brother, in the acclaimed series <a href=# rel=follow>The Vampire Diaries</a>. He portrayed Jeremy in the series from 2009 to 2015. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>In 2018, he reprised his role in the spin-off of The Vampire Diaries, Legacies. Because of the franchise, McQueen garnered a massive fanbase who was curious about his love life. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Mostly, the question revolving around his personal&nbsp;life is if he has a girlfriend or even a wife. However, as of 2022, there is no news about McQueen being married or having a wife.</p><p>Similarly, it is unknown if he has a girlfriend. However, back in 2018, he was very close to calling someone his wife.</p><h2>Alexandra Silva&nbsp;â€”&nbsp;Steven R. McQueen's Almost Wife</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>It is unknown when Alexandra "Allie" Silva and McQueen initially started dating. However, it is reported that they were linked in 2016. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The pair made their relationship Instagram official in December 2016. McQueen shared a picture with his girlfriend when they went skiing, confirming the rumors about the duo dating.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Throughout 2017, the pair often shared pictures of one another on social media. In addition, they went on road trips and went to Nicaragua to help build homes there.</p><p>Fast forward to 2018, McQueen asked Silva to be his wife on January 25. The Chicago P.D. star took to Instagram to announce that he was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">engaged</a> to his girlfriend. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Steven R. McQueen proposed to Alexandra "Allie" Silva to be his wife but later called it off.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>)</p><p>He posted a black and white picture of the two kissing over dinner.

The model also took to Instagram to share the news of her engagement.</p><p>She uploaded the same pictures as her beau and captioned them as, "My best friend, love of my life...YES, yes yes a million times over," and tagged him.</p><h2>The Unfortunate Breakup</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Before McQueen could make Silva his wife, the two parted ways. They called off the engagement five months after McQueen proposed to the model.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>He confirmed it via <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Us Weekly</a>&nbsp;on May 4, 2018, while attending the&nbsp;Voices In Displacement Gala hosted by The Syrian American Medical Society. He was asked about his wedding with&nbsp;his soon-to-be spouse.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>It was then he admitted the two had canceled the plans and called off their engagement. He said, "You know what? Actually, we called it off."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He did not give any&nbsp;reasons for the cancellation but simply said, "We did. But yeah, it's just the way it was. It happened." He added he was not dating anyone at the moment and was focusing on himself.</p><p>He was "enjoying me time" by doing various activities like&nbsp;hiking with his dogs and boxing. Moreover, Silva and McQueen have deleted all their photos together from their social media. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Since his split with&nbsp;Silva, McQueen has not revealed if he has dated anyone.&nbsp;But apart from Silva, he has been <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">linked</a> with different celebrities like&nbsp;Candice Accola, Chelsea Kane, <a href=# rel=follow>Dylan Penn</a>, and Hillary Harley.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKukmsOmuoyrZKaboaqyprqMsKCfnV6dwa64</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./exploring-the-enhancement-of-fierce-deity-armor-in-tears-of-the-kingdom-and-addressing-the-durabilit.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Exploring the Enhancement of Fierce Deity Armor in Tears of the Kingdom and Addressing the Durabilit">&larr;
