Jared, Katherine (Kat), and Nadjha requested meals prepared by islanders. Jeff prepared dinner for Nadjha, and Isaiah prepared the sweet treat.</p><p>She immediately clicked with Isaiah, who had recently had the opportunity to be with Sydney at Hideaway, on her individual dates with the two males. However, after spending some time with Nadjha, Isaiah found it difficult to decide between Sydney and her.</p><p>Jeff had the first opportunity to choose his partner during the recoupling round, and he went with Nadjha. The latter appeared unhappy with the choice because she preferred to remain with Isaiah. The supporters didn’t like the fact that she was even seen crying for him.</p><p id=caption-attachment-50067 class=wp-caption-text>Nadjha is the new islander on Love Island USA Season 4</p><h2>What are&nbsp;Love Island USA&nbsp;fans saying about Nadjha crying?</h2><p>On Twitter, viewers discussed Nadjha’s tears over Isaiah. They thought it strange that she cried for someone she had only known for a short while. Some viewers even felt sorry for Jeff since he might not click with his companion as quickly as he anticipated.</p><p>Following the recoupling round, Nadjha was spotted discussing Isaiah with Zeta. Despite knowing that Isaiah had a string connection to Sydney, she claimed to have come to the villa for Isaiah when speaking to the OG islander. Although Zeta claimed to adore Sydney, she added that a “connection is a connection.” Kat approached Nadjha when she saw her crying to comfort her.</p><p>The boys were required to present a speech in Episode 17 of Love Island USA Season 4 outlining their bond with the female they would choose. Following the reading of his speech, Jeff selected Nadjha:</p><p>Despite her displeasure with the choice to recouple, Nadjha was seen attempting to work things out with Jeff. Isaiah was the person she wanted to team up with because, given the choice, he would have chosen Nadjha over Jeff. In the end, Isaiah decided on Sydney, the person he has been dating for a very long time.</p><p>Sydney was alarmed after witnessing Nadjha sob over Isaiah. She warned Jeff that if Nadjha moved any further, they would run into trouble. Jeff was also unsure about his choice of Nadjha because she didn’t seem interested in him during their conversation. When he sought guidance from Chazz and Kat, they both reassured him that the novice would open up to him eventually.</p><p>Love Island USA opened the voting polls for the upcoming Casa Amor episode, even though the love triangle is expected to generate a lot of turmoil. If friendships and relationships suffer in the upcoming episode, only time will tell.</p><p>New episodes of Love Island USA Season 4 can be seen on Peacock every Tuesday through Sunday at 9:00 PM ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrBorjKrKuonJGue6S7zGiuobFdlr%2BmecWapaxlo6GurrnIp55mppGZt6mtjJ%2Bmq2WTp8aqusZmpq%2BdomK2tK3Imp9moZ5iubDCxGagrKSRo7FuwdKaZKydkai8r3mTZmlo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./chris-redd-photos-hollywood-life.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chris Redd  PHOTOS  Hollywood Life">&larr;
