His college career culminated in 2005 when he was named to the All-Mountain West Conference team.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Hank_Baskett_Career></span>Hank Baskett Career&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Baskett’s professional football career began in 2006 when he was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the sixth round of the NFL Draft.</p><p>He spent two seasons with the Eagles before being traded to the Indianapolis Colts in 2008. After one season with the Colts, he signed with the Minnesota Vikings in 2009.

After initially refuting the accusations, Baskett eventually acknowledged the incident, stating that his drug use at the time had left him in a condition of “confusion and despair”.</p><p>The controversy severely strained Baskett’s marriage and sparked a media frenzy. Understandably devastated by the betrayal, Wilkinson and his partner temporarily parted ways.</p><p>But in the end, they made the decision to resolve their differences and keep their union intact.
