Their music genres differed significantly from their daughter's, as the duo mainly sang gospel music.</p><p class=Zg>Robert and Carol initially resided in Port of Spain, Trinidad, and Tobago, before relocating to New York in the late 1980s. There, they would raise their children, including Nicki Minaj, who would emerge as a superstar in 2010.</p><p class=Zg>Their marriage was, however, not always cordial. They faced many bad moments, caused mainly by Robert's anger and drug issues. By the time Robert died in 2021, he had become estranged from his wife.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Nicki Minaj and Carol Maraj attend the 2015 BET Awards at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles, California on June 28, 2015 | Source: Getty Images</p><p><h2 class=ch><strong class=Xg>Robert Maraj Was Also a Singer, like His Daughter</strong></h2></p><p class=Zg>Although not a full-time artist, Robert was a capable <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/1521727/nicki-minaj-who-are-her-parents/>singer</a>. He is credited as a part-time gospel singer. However, his main job was that of a financial executive.</p><p class=Zg>However, besides their father's prestigious title, Minaj and her siblings were raised mainly by their mother and grandmother. Robert was reportedly a drug addict with anger management problems, eventually leading to his abusive nature. He is said to have burned down the family house due to his failure to control his anger.</p><p class=Zg>Robert passed on in 2021 in unfortunate circumstances. He was a victim of a <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/feb/14/nicki-minaj-father-robert-maraj-killed-hit-and-run-accident>hit-and-run</a> accident in Mineola, Long Island. The 64-year-old was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital. The police arrested a man believed to have been the hit-and-run driver. After the arrest, Carol filed a <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/mar/22/nicki-minaj-mother-carol-150m-lawsuit-driver-accused-killing-father>lawsuit</a> against the man for a staggering $150 million.</p><p><h2 class=ch><strong class=Xg>Robert Once Set up Fire on House When Nicki's Mother Was Inside</strong></h2></p><p class=Zg>Although Minaj currently seems to have a very stable and good life, she had to endure some bad times to get to where she is today.

Her Instagram followers are north of 225k, an incredible flex for the 62-year-old who only recorded her music a few years ago despite having written the songs in 2004.</p><p class=Zg>On her Instagram, she usually posts things related to her personal life, such as photos of her daughter <a class="zd d" href=#>Nicki Minaj</a> and granddaughter.
