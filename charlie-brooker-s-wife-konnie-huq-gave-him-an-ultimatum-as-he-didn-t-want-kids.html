Two was just a nuclear family, so boring,” she added.</p><p></p><p><strong>Charlie Brooker with his wife Konnie Huq.</strong> (Photo: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She continued to explain, “Three is a dynasty, three is like a team and then I had two and I was like ‘no way!’ Two is company and three’s a crowd.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>And while she had such plans about her future family in the late 2000s, she recalled Brooker, her then-boyfriend, had no plans on having children.</p><p>After quickly realizing his intentions, she informed him that it was a&nbsp;deal-breaker. In addition, she told him that she would not marry him if they did not have kids in the future. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>That said, Brooker’s wife also defended him by saying that he was unsure about having kids because he had not met the right person to make him realize the value of a family with kids.</p><p>“And so... he obviously saw the gene pool that I possessed and thought ‘it wouldn’t be right!’ I dunno, he just sort of changed his mind,” she further recalled.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Charlie Brooker and Konnie Huq Are Together since 2009</h2><p>Moving onto their relationship,&nbsp;Brooker and Huq first met&nbsp;during an episode of his show, Screenwipe, in 2009. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Even though they started as friends, they soon fell in love and relished a relationship. Nine months later, in June 2010, they got engaged.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>And it was allegedly during that dating phase the couple had sorted out their opinions about children.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In the previous podcast,&nbsp;Brooker's spouse even revealed the quality that drew her close to her husband. She stated that one thing that attracted her to him was his skills in "having a telephone conversation."</p><p>"I always say I am really analog and Charlie is really digital. My oldest is digital and my youngest is analog," she added. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Fast forward to the present and&nbsp;Brooker and his family are still going strong.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Even though the lockdown and pandemic were quite hard, they reportedly took it quite&nbsp;seriously in their house and hardly went out at all.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Happy Mother’s Day all.
