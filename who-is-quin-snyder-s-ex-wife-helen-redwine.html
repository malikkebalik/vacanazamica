But their marriage did not last for a long period of time as the duo got separated in 2006 after they had a son, Owen Snyder.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Helen Redwine‘s Biography</strong></h3><ul><li><span><strong>Full Name</strong>: Helen Redwine</span></li><li><strong>Birth Year</strong>: 1972</li><li><strong>Helen Redwine’s Age:</strong> 51 years old</li><li><span><strong>Gender</strong>: Female</span></li><li><span><strong>Ethnicity</strong>: White</span></li><li><span><strong>Nationality</strong>: American</span></li><li><span><strong>Sexual Orientation</strong>: Straight</span></li><li><span><strong>Religion</strong>: Christianity</span></li><li><span><strong>Marital Status</strong>: Divorced</span></li><li><span><strong>Helen Redwine’s Husband</strong>: Quin Snyder</span></li><li><span><strong>Helen Redwine’s Children</strong>: Owen Snyder</span></li><li><span><strong>Helen Redwine’s height in Inches</strong>: 5 feet 3 inches</span></li><li><span><strong>Helen Redwine’s body weight</strong>: 65 kg</span></li><li><span><strong>Famous for</strong>: Being Quin Snyder’s ex-wife</span></li><li><span><strong>Helen Redwine’s Instagram</strong>: </span><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><span>@helenmredwine</span></a></li></ul><h2><b>Helen Redwine was Born an American Some 51 Years Ago</b></h2><p>Helen Redwine was born in the United States many years ago. She was born into a Caucasian American family and is of white ethnicity. Her mother’s name is Helen Wright Redwine, and she was named after her mother. Her father’s name is unknown.</p><p>Despite the popularity that Helen Redwine’s marriage with her estranged husband brought to her, she did not stop living a private life. There is little or no information about her exact date of birth. We only know the year she was given birth, which is 1972, and that makes her 51 years old this year.</p><p>Growing up, not much is known about what Helen Redwine’s childhood experiences looked like, but it is known that Helen went to Charlotte Country Day School and later proceeded to Myers Park High School. It is recorded that she had a stint in Cape Fear Community College before she moved to Duke University, where she bagged her Bachelor’s Degree in Psychology.</p><h2><strong>She Became Quin Synder’s Wife in 1999 and had a Son with Him in 2002</strong></h2><p>Helen Redwine and Quin Synder got engaged long before Quin took up Missouri’s manager job. They were high school sweethearts. Quin Snyder walked down the aisle with his beloved wife on September 24, 1999, in a private ceremony with their loved ones and family in attendance.</p><p>Unfortunately, the union did not last for a long period of time. It only lasted for seven years as they announced their separation in 2006. The union did produce a son named Owen Snyder, who was born in 2002. Currently, Owen is about 21 years old, and he has grown to become a sports enthusiast like his father.</p><p>The information available about Owen has it that he plays baseball with the Canadian Victoria Mariners, which participates in the British Columbia Premier Baseball League (BCPBL) as an OF/1B. However, his team’s last recorded participation in the league dates back to 2019, and as such, it has not been ascertained whether or not he is still with the team.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/8143edd69a2d320c1ebf5ba2eb49a508.jpg><h3><strong>Quin Snyder and Helen Redwine Separated in 2006</strong></h3><p>Quin Snyder has moved on as he is now married to Amy Snyder, whom he met in 2006, the same year he got separated from Helen Redwine. The reason for their separation or divorce was not known, as neither of them gave any reason online. However, Helen Redwine has been single since the divorce and has not been linked to any man.</p><p>Amy Snyder, Quin Snyder’s new wife, is the Co-founder and director of Curriculum Design and Evaluation of PEER. Quin Snyder walked her down the aisle in 2010 in a private ceremony, and they are still together, living a blissful married life.</p><h2><b>What Does Quin Snyder, Helen Redwine’s Ex-husband, do for a Living?</b></h2><p>Quin Snyder is a famous basketball coach and a basketball player who has been active in the game of basketball since 1999. He has worked as an assistant coach for more than two decades at Duke University, Philadephia 76ers, Los Angeles, CSKA Moscow, and Atlanta Hawks after years of extracting knowledge from some of the great coaches like Doug Collins, Mike Brown, and Gregg Popovich.</p><p>He has also served as the head coach for the Utah Jazz of the National Basketball Association. He was once selected as the western Conference head Coach for the 2021 NBA All-star Game, and he was the coach of the year finalist for the NBA.</p><h3><strong>Helen was Instrumental to Quin’s Earlier Career Successes as a Basketball Coach</strong></h3><p>Helen Redwine played a significant role in the career of his estranged husband. She supported him when he was the head coach at Missouri, and she aided him in discovering his potential as a Basketball coach.</p><p>While Quinn was coaching Missouri’s Tigers, the team defeated highly rated opponents like Illinois and Kansas. The team win earned him the Rookie Coach of the Year award. He later joined Austin Toros and led them to D-League finals, and he was named Dennis Johnson Coach of the Year.</p><p>No doubt, Quin pretty much had a successful career as a basketball coach before he retired from the sport to try other groups and organizations. He said in an interview, “After eight years, I just feel it is time to move onward. I needed to take time to detach after the season and make sure this is the right decision”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/Helen-Redwine.jpg><h3><b>What Does Quin Snyder’s Ex-wife do for a Living?</b></h3><p>Helen Redwine worked as a realtor from 2007 to 2012. She had previously worked at Food to Die, but her current profession or career path is quite unknown at the moment. Her net worth is not known at the moment, but her estranged husband has an estimated net worth of $7 million. He earns his money from his career as a basketball coach with an annual salary of $2 million.</p><h3><b>Where Does Helen Redwine Live Currently?</b></h3><p>Helen Redwine’s current residence is Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina, where she resides with her son, Owen Snycher, and her pets. She has three dogs, but unfortunately, two of them named Ajax and Max passed away in 2017 and 2015, leaving her with just one.
