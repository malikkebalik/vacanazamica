She is 20 years old and American by nationality. She is also a Christian.</p><p>Olivia was raised in neighboring Temecula by her parents; her father is a family and marriage therapist named Chris Rodrigo, and her mother’s school teacher is named Sophia Rodrigo. However, as the only child in her family, she has no siblings.</p><h2><strong>What is Olivia Rodrigo’s Ethnicity?</strong></h2><p>Olivia Rodrigo is Filipino American. Her father, Chris Rodrigo, is Filipino, while her mother, Sophia Rodrigo, has German and Irish ancestry. Therefore, Olivia is of mixed ethnicity.</p><p>Furthermore, her paternal great-grandfather <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">left the Philippines</a> for the United States as a teenager, but her family nonetheless follows <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Filipino traditions and cuisine.</a></p><h2><strong>What Nationality is Olivia Rodrigo?</strong></h2><p>Although Olivia is of mixed Filipino, German, and Irish descent, she is an American by nationality. She was born in America, thus making her a citizen by birth. However, her parents are not from America. Olivia’s mum hails from Germany and Ireland, while her dad is from the Philippines.</p><h2><strong>Who is Olivia Rodrigo’s Mom?</strong></h2><p>Her mother, Sophia Rodrigo, is a school teacher. She is of Irish and German ancestry. Alongside her husband Ronald, Sophia has been supportive of her daughter’s career. The duo <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">home-schooled Olivia</a> and made sure she knew how to play the piano as a child.</p><p>Sophia also played an important role in the making of Olivia’s hit single Driver’s License. With her permission, Olivia used her mother’s car when <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">creating the noises</a> on the track. As her only child, Sophia loved her daughter Olivia so much and always supported her in every way.</p><h2><strong>Meet Olivia Rodrigo’s Dad</strong></h2><p>Her father, Ronald Rodrigo, is a family and marriage therapist. He has Filipino ancestry and is a Christian. Growing up in Temecula, California, Olivia’s father is the grandson of a Filipino immigrant, which makes him a third-generation <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Filipino American</a>.</p><h2><strong>Her Parents Played a Crucial Role in Her Career Success&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Her parents reportedly had a huge role in her pursuing music. Her parents, Ronald and Sophia Rodrigo, encouraged her to take piano lessons at the age of nine. Although she hated playing the piano, her parents <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">forced</a> her to play and take music lessons to build her musical career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/ezgif.com-gif-maker-9.jpg><h3><strong>Are Her Parents Still Together?</strong></h3><p>Her parents, Ronald and Sophia Rodrigo, are still married. The couple has been together for close to three decades, with Olivia being their only child. The pair currently live in Temecula, California.</p><p>However, their daughter lives in Los Angeles, where she pursues her acting career. Olivia recently <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">mentioned in an interview</a> that her parents usually come over to spend time with her and encourage her. Likewise, she visits them regularly and spends time with them during her free time. From all indications, the family is living a happy life.</p><h2><strong>She Started Singing at Age 5</strong></h2><p>Olivia’s interest in music developed when she was only a child. It was her mother, Sophia, who introduced her to alternative rock such as the White Stripes, No Doubt, and Smashing Pumpkins. And soon enough, she became a music freak.</p><p>Olivia showed an early affinity for music. At the age of 5, she began attending singing lessons. She was quick to learn and soon began competing in local contests and talent shows. In addition, she was writing songs at a young age.</p><p>When the talented American was 9, she began piano lessons. However, she had <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">no interest</a> in studying the piano but soon came to appreciate that the instrument was instrumental in her songwriting.</p><p>Olivia’s youthful songwriting compositions often centered around <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">heartbreak</a>, even before she’d had a boyfriend. She envisioned what heartbreak feels like and put them to music.</p><h3><strong>She Had Her Lead Role at Age 10</strong></h3><p>By the time she was 6, Olivia was already taking acting classes. She played in school productions but was also attending auditions for professional jobs. To do this, her mother would take her on a 90-mile trek to the city of Los Angeles.</p><p>Olivia wasn’t an overnight success. Her parents, who never encouraged her to become a child actress, <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">urged</a> their daughter to stop auditioning. However, she was determined to continue. At 10, she got the lead role in “An American Girl: Grace Stirs Up Success” in 2015.</p><p>And when she was 12 years old, Olivia Rodrigo was cast as Paige Olvera on “Bizaardvark” (2016-19). Similarly,&nbsp; at 15, the fast-rising actress landed a starring role as Nini Salazar-Roberts in “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series.”</p><p>Furthermore, Olivia performed the resulting ballad, “All I Want,” when she was only 16. It instantly became a hit for “HSM:TM:TS,” chatting on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2020 and shooting her to global fame.</p><h2><strong>What is Olivia Rodrigo’s Net Worth?</strong></h2><p>She is a successful young American singer, songwriter, and actress with an estimated net worth of $5 million. She gets the majority of her earnings from her singing and acting career.</p><p>Olivia made her first screen appearance at age 12 in an “Old Navy” TV commercial in 2015. Later that year, she debuted in a film titled “An American Girl: Grace Stirs Up Success.” She slowly started gaining recognition due to her performances in “Bizaardvark” (2016) and “New Girl” (2017).</p><p>In 2019, Olivia came into the spotlight thanks to her lead role in a Disney+ original series titled “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series.” Furthermore, her fame skyrocketed with the release of her debut solo song titled “drivers license,” released in January 2021.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunDA0ZqaoqaXYryttdWimGaqn5m%2FqrPOrGSerJijtqS107Jkp5mknryvrcuiq7JlkaOxbrzAq5ynrKNis6K5yKWwZqqfpMG0ew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-are-tessa-thompson-s-parents-a-look-at-her-early-life-age.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Are Tessa Thompsons Parents?
